Predictions_Using_Linear_Regression-One_Varaible-
In this sample project we are going to predict the scores based on the number of hours of study using Linear Regression in One Variable.

Linear Regression in One Variable is a simple Linear Regression Machine Learning algorithm, in which a value of a variable (dependent variable) is predicted based on the value of another variable (independent variable).

In this case the dependent variable, the value of which we have to predict is 'Scores', while the independent variable, on which the value of Scores depends is, 'Hours'.

The data used in the above project is a sample data of 25 rows, which is available on the following link: http://bit.ly/w-data
